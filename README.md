### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am n-leadbetter!
### I'm a student at Lancaster University, currently working on a project to develop an autonomous robot for radioactive environments.
### I'm very new to coding, so there's going to be a bit of a learning curve, but with the help of my team, I'm sure there won't be a problem we can't solve.
## Thank you for reading!
